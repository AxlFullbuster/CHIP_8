This is a small project that focuses on creating a CHIP-8 Emulator.

It uses SDL to display the games and currently only works on linux machines. Windows support will be added sometime in the future.

It uses Cmake to compile this is what you'll need to do
cmake .
make
./CHIP_8 "Rom file name*

The rom file has to be in the same directory as the executable.

Current Status: Debugging and Testing
