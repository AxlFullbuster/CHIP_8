This is a small project that focuses on creating a CHIP-8 Emulator.

The code structure and layout was taken and referenced from this CHIP-8 Emulator tutorial: http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/

Besides the layout and structure all of the code was written by me.

Current progress: Implemented all operation codes for the emulator

What needs to be done: Graphics implementation, Input implementation, loading the game into memory.
